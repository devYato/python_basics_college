## python basic

### 1. Python Basics
- **Python** is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and simplicity.

- **Python** is dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to declare variable types explicitly.

- **Python** supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.

- **Python** has a large standard library and a vibrant ecosystem of third-party packages, making it suitable for various applications, from web development to data analysis and machine learning.

### 2. Python Syntax

- **Python** uses indentation to define code blocks, which enhances readability.

- **Python** uses the `#` symbol for single-line comments and triple quotes (`'''` or `"""`) for multi-line comments.

- **Python** uses colons (`:`) to indicate the start of a block, such as in function definitions, loops, and conditionals.

- **Python** uses the `print()` function to display output to the console.

- **Python** uses the `input()` function to read user input from the console.

### 3. Variables and Data Types

- **Python** has several built-in data types, including:
  - **Numeric Types**: `int`, `float`, and `complex`
  - **Sequence Types**: `list`, `tuple`, and `range`
  - **Text Type**: `str`
  - **Mapping Type**: `dict`
  - **Set Types**: `set` and `frozenset`
  - **Boolean Type**: `bool`
  - **Binary Types**: `bytes`, `bytearray`, and `memoryview`

- **Python** uses dynamic typing, allowing you to change the type of a variable at runtime.

- **Python** supports type hints, enabling you to specify the expected data types of variables and function parameters for better code clarity and static analysis.

### 4. Control Flow

- **Python** uses `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements for conditional execution.
